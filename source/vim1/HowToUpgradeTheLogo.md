title: How To Upgrade The Logo
---


We use [Fenix](/vim1/FenixScript.html) to build Ubuntu/Debian images, The default logo is  `archives/logo/bmp/logo.bmp`, so you can use your own bmp file to replace the default one.

*Note: The NMP file should be 24 bpp.*

You can also to replace the logo file directly in the ready to use image. The logo file is in `/usr/share/fenix/logo/logo.bmp`, so you can replace this file directly.
