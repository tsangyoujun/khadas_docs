### Upgrading Steps
Make sure that you have installed the correct USB Upgrade Tool, then follow the steps below to upgrade:

1. Open `USB_Burning_Tool_v2.x.x.exe`, click ‘File-->Import Image’ to chose an [image](https://dl.khadas.com/Firmware/) for your VIM. 3rd Party Firmware, e.g. Voluminio: [VIM1](https://docs.khadas.com/vim1/FirmwareThirdparty.html) / [VIM2](https://docs.khadas.com/vim2/FirmwareThirdparty.html)
2. Connect your VIM to your PC with a USB-C cable (VIM will power on automatically).
3. Place your VIM into "Upgrade Mode":
	* Long press the `Power` key without releasing.
	* Short press `Reset` key and release it.
	* Count to 10 seconds and release the `Power` key.
4. If you have performed steps 2 and 3 correctly, your PC will automatically discover your VIM as a connected USB-device.

	Now all you need to do is to click the `Start` button of the tool and wait for upgrading to complete:
