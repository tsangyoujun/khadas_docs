# Making Bootable/Burning SD-Cards/Thumbdrives
These items are useful when you want to upgrade your VIM2 SBC's operating system via SD-Card or Thumbdrive (Burning Cards). Or if you want to run operating systems that can only be run from external media (Booting Cards) like LibreELEC.

1. 8GB or Larger, SD-Card
2. SD-Card Reader
3. Laptop / Desktop PC
4. 8GB or Larger, USB-Thumbdrive (U-Disk)

**Tips:**
* **eMMC image** should be burned directly to the eMMC using a USB-C data cable, from a Ubuntu or Windows Host. It must not be burned into an SD-Card. For Example: Android and Ubuntu distributions containing the `EMMC` mark.
* **SD/USB image** should be copied into an SD-Card, before that card is then used to reformat the eMMC storage with a new OS. For Example: Armbian, Ubuntu distributions containing the `SD_USB` mark, as well as LibreELEC and CoreELEC.
* In order to bootup from **SD/USB images**, you need Android (V180209 or newer) or Ubuntu (V180531 or newer) running on your eMMC with Multi-Boot activated.

# Upgrading eMMC Operating System Using USB-C Cable
You'll need these items if you want to use your laptop or desktop PC to upgrade your VIM2 SBC's operating system stored in its eMMC storage. For example, changing the bootup operating system from Android to Ubuntu, or installing a more exotic 3rd-party OS.

1. USB-A to USB-C Data Cable (Legacy Computers)
2. USB-C to USB-C Data Cable (Modern Computers)
3. Laptop / Desktop PC

# Watching Movies, Expanding Internal eMMC Storage

1. 64GB or larger, USB-2.0/3.0 HDD / SSD
2. 64GB or larger, *microSDXC UHS-I* SD-Card
